Most of the time arbitraries are used indirectly, i.e. _jqwik_ uses them under
the hood to inject generated values as parameters. There are situations, though,
in which you might want to generate values directly.

### Generating a Single Value

Getting a single random value out of an arbitrary is easy and can be done
with [`Arbitrary.sample()`](/docs/${docsVersion}/javadoc/net/jqwik/api/Arbitrary.html#sample()):

```java
Arbitrary<String> strings = Arbitraries.of("string1", "string2", "string3");
String aString = strings.sample();
assertThat(aString).isIn("string1", "string2", "string3");
```

Among other things, this allows you to use jqwik's generation functionality
with other test engines like Jupiter.
Mind that _jqwik_ uses a default `genSize` of 1000 under the hood and that
the `Random` object will be either taken from the current property's context or
freshly instantiated if used outside a property.

### Generating a Stream of Values

Getting a stream of generated values is just as easy with [`Arbitrary.sampleStream()`](/docs/${docsVersion}/javadoc/net/jqwik/api/Arbitrary.html#sampleStream()):

```java
List<String> values = Arrays.asList("string1", "string2", "string3");
Arbitrary<String> strings = Arbitraries.of(values);
Stream<String> streamOfStrings = strings.sampleStream().limit(100);

assertThat(streamOfStrings).allMatch(values::contains);
```

### Generating all possible values

There are a few cases when you don't want to generate individual values from an
arbitrary but use all possible values to construct another arbitrary. This can be achieved through
[`Arbitrary.allValues()`](/docs/${docsVersion}/javadoc/net/jqwik/api/Arbitrary.html#allValues()).

Return type is `Optional<Stream<T>>` because _jqwik_ can only perform this task if
[exhaustive generation](#exhaustive-generation) is doable.


### Iterating through all possible values

You can also use an arbitrary to iterate through all values it specifies.
Use
[`Arbitrary.forEachValue(Consumer action)`](/docs/${docsVersion}/javadoc/net/jqwik/api/Arbitrary.html#forEachValue(java.util.function.Consumer)).
for that purpose. This only works when [exhaustive generation](#exhaustive-generation) is possible.
In other cases the attempt to iterate will result in an exception.

This is typically useful when your test requires to assert some fact for all
values of a given (sub)set of objects. Here's a contrived example:

```java
@Property
void canPressAnyKeyOnKeyboard(@ForAll Keyboard keyboard, @ForAll Key key) {
    keyboard.press(key);
    assertThat(keyboard.isPressed(key));

    Arbitrary<Key> unpressedKeys = Arbitraries.of(keyboard.allKeys()).filter(k -> !k.equals(key));
    unpressedKeys.forEachValue(k -> assertThat(keyboard.isPressed(k)).isFalse());
}
```

In this example a simple for loop over `allKeys()` would also work. In more complicated scenarios
_jqwik_ will do all the combinations and filtering for you.


### Using Arbitraries Outside Jqwik Lifecycle

All the methods mentioned in this chapter can be used outside a property, 
which also means outside jqwik's lifecycle control. 
Probably the most prominent reason to do that is to experiment with arbitraries
and value generation in a Java console or a main method.
Another reason can be to use jqwik's data generation capabilities for testing
data in Jupiter or Cucumber tests.

In principal, there's no problem with that approach.
However, some generators are expensive to create and will therefore be cached.
Other generators require some data persistence across generation iterations to
work as expected.
All this data will fill up your heap space and never be released, because
jqwik cannot know, if you're done with using a specific generator or not.

In order to mitigate that, there's an experimental API that allows you
to simulate a small part of jqwik's property lifecycle. 
Currently this API consists of a few static methods on class `net.jqwik.api.sessions.JqwikSession`:

- `JqwikSession.start()`: Start explicitly a session for using arbitraries and generators.
- `JqwikSession.isActive()`: Check is a session is currently active.
- `JqwikSession.finish()`: Finish the currently active session, thereby releasing all the implicitly used memory space.
- `JqwikSession.finishTry()`: Announce that you're done with the current `trie` of a property.
  This will, for example, reset the uniqueness collector of a generator for collections.
- `JqwikSession.run(Runnable code)`: Wrap the runnable code segment in implicit `start()` and `finish()` calls.

Mind that there's currently no way to use nested sessions, spread the same session across threads
or use more than one session concurrently.
