/*
 * This file essentially extracts the versions of external dependencies.
 * With its name "dependencies.gradle", it should be detected and processed by Dependabot.
 * See https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/configuration-options-for-dependency-updates
 * also https://dev.to/cricketsamya/gradle-with-dependabot-1o47
 *
 * Keeping the extra properties in the root 'build.gradle' file does not work as some
 * properties are required by our pre-compiled plugin before we had a chance to define them
 * (no regular code is allowed before 'buildscript'/'plugins').
 *
 * Since Gradle 7.0 there is a new (better option to centralize dependency versions with a version catalog
 * (see https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html#sec:sharing-catalogs), but
 * it is not (yet) supported by Dependabot, renovate, etc.
