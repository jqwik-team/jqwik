## Maintenance Mode

> Currently, jqwik is in pure maintenance mode.
> That means, that as long as no further sponsoring or 
> other funding shows up, 
> no further feature development will take place -
> unless the jqwik team has some personal interest in such a feature.
> 
> What will happen, though, is a regular update of upstream
> dependencies - like the JUnit platform - 
> and fixing crucial bugs. 
> The triage of bugs into "crucial" and "non-crucial" is
> fully up to the jqwik team.
