## 1.6.2-SNAPSHOT

<p style="padding-left:1em;font-size:larger">
<a href="/docs/snapshot/user-guide.html">User guide</a>,
<a href="/docs/snapshot/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>
and <a href="/docs/snapshot/kdoc/index.html">kdoc</a>
</p>



#### New and Enhanced Features

- Added `PropertyDefaults.maxDiscardRatio`

#### Breaking Changes

- Parameter annotations on array types (e.g. `@WithNull String[]`) 
  [are no longer applied to the component type](/docs/snapshot/user-guide.html#constraining-array-types).

- The jqwik database now only stores data of failing tests and properties.

#### Bug Fixes

- Using `@WithNull` on primitive array types no longer leads to an `IllegalArgumentException`.
  See https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/270.

- Generic array types in parameters can now be properly resolved

## 1.6.1

<p style="padding-left:1em;font-size:larger">
<a href="/docs/1.6.1/user-guide.html">User guide</a>,
<a href="/docs/1.6.1/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>
and <a href="/docs/1.6.1/kdoc/index.html">kdoc</a>
</p>

#### New and Enhanced Features

- Added `TypeArbitrary.enableRecursion()` to enable recursive usage of type based
  generation for types that do not have an applicable default arbitrary.

- `@UseType` now has an additional attribute `enableRecursion`,
  which is set to `true` by default.

- Added experimental `Arbitraries.traverse(..)` as a mechanism to traverse a type
  and all the types it depends on for arbitrary generation.

- `TypeArbitrary.use(Executable creator)` is now deprecated and will be removed in 1.8.0

- A container class will now inherit `@PropertiesDefault` annotations from superclass and interfaces.

- A container class will now inherit `@AddLifecycleHook` annotations from superclass and interfaces.

- A container class will now inherit `@Domain` annotations from superclass and interfaces.

- A container class will now inherit `@Tag` annotations from superclass and interfaces.

- Subclasses of `DomainContextBase` can now implement `ArbitraryProvider` which
  is used as a provider for this domain.

- Subclasses of `DomainContextBase` can now implement `ArbitraryConfigurator` which
  is used as a configurator for this domain.

- Multi-value arbitraries (ListArbitrary, SetArbitrary etc.) check minSize and maxSize
  values at configuration time now.

- Upgrade to Kotlin 1.6.0. Versions 1.5.x should still work with the binary. 

- `DomainContext` implementation classes can now be annotated with `@Domain` themselves. 

- Tags added to containers or property methods through `@Tag` annotations
  are now being reported in execution result report as part of the key.

- After failure modes `SAMPLE_ONLY` and `SAMPLE_FIRST` now discover changes
  to parameter configuration with better accuracy, which leads to fewer
  "impossible" samples being injected into property methods.

- Upgrade to JUnit Platform 1.8.2

#### Breaking Changes

- Inherited property defaults could change behaviour of existing properties

- Inherited lifecycle hooks could break existing properties

- Inherited domain contexts could break existing properties

- `@UseType` will by default allow recursively resolve by type

#### Bug Fixes

- `Arbitraries.defaultFor(..)` did not apply configurators, but does now.

- Kotlin provider methods can now have `internal` modifier

## 1.6.0

<p style="padding-left:1em;font-size:larger">
<a href="/docs/1.6.0/user-guide.html">User guide</a>,
<a href="/docs/1.6.0/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>
and <a href="/docs/1.6.0/kdoc/index.html">kdoc</a>
</p>

#### New and Enhanced Features

- Added new module [`jqwik-kotlin`](/docs/1.6.0/user-guide.html#kotlin-module) 
  for improved Kotlin support.

- Introduced new lifecycle hook [`InvokePropertyMethodHook`](/docs/1.6.0/user-guide.html#invokepropertymethodhook) 
  in order to support some Kotlin specialties.

- Introduced new lifecycle hook [`ProvidePropertyInstanceHook`](/docs/1.6.0/user-guide.html#providepropertyinstancehook) 
  in order to allow Kotlin singleton objects as test containers.

- Promoted APIs from `EXPERIMENTAL` to `MAINTAINED`:
    - `net.jqwik.api.Arbitrary.ignoreException(..)`
    - `net.jqwik.api.Property.whenFixedSeed`
    - `net.jqwik.api.RandomDistribution` and its usages in numerical arbitraries
    - `net.jqwik.api.arbitraries.ArbitraryDecorator`
    - `net.jqwik.api.constraints.NotBlank`
    - `net.jqwik.api.domains.DomainContextBase`
    - `net.jqwik.api.statistics.StatisticsReport`

- Upgraded to JUnit Platform 1.8.1

- Added experimental `JqwikSession` API to 
  [use arbitraries outside jqwik's lifecycle](/docs/1.6.0/user-guide.html#using-arbitraries-outside-jqwik-lifecycle).

- Added `Functions.FunctionWrapper.returning()` as replacement for deprecated `returns()`.

- Added explicit module information for all modules.
  See https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/243. 
  Thank you https://github.com/sormuras for the support!


#### Breaking Changes

- Removed `AbstractDomainContextBase` which had been deprecated in 1.5.2

- `@WithNull` now has a default probability of 0.05 instead of 0.1

- Configuration through a `jqwik.properties` file is no longer supported.
  Please use [JUnit Platform configuration](/docs/1.6.0/user-guide.html#jqwik-configuration) instead.

- If a property methods returns `false` or `Boolean.FALSE` it will now be considered to have failed.
  All other return values - including `null` - are regarded as success.
  Before this version the method's return type had to be `boolean` or `Boolean` for the return value to matter.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed memory leak when calling `Arbitrary.sample()` in jqwik scope.
  See https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/236.

- Sometimes Kotlin method names have a postfix. 
  They can now be resolved and have normal display names.

- Arbitrary.withoutEdgeCases() sometimes did not work in combination with 
  filter, map and flatMap.

- When an arbitrary fails to generate values, the property seed will now be reported.

<p style="padding-left:1em;font-size:larger">
<a href="/docs/1.5.3/user-guide.html">User guide</a>
and
<a href="/docs/1.5.3/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>
</p>

#### New and Enhanced Features

- You can now influence the random distribution of 
  [the size of generated multi-value containers](/docs/1.5.3/user-guide.html#size-of-multi-value-containers) 
  (sets, lists, arrays, streams, iterators and maps).

- You can now influence the random distribution of 
  [the size of generated strings](/docs/1.5.3/user-guide.html#string-size).

</p>


#### New and Enhanced Features

- Added new base class 
  [`DomainContextBase`](/docs/1.5.2/javadoc/net/jqwik/api/domains/DomainContextBase.html), which changes the way 
  how you typically [provide domain contexts](/docs/1.5.2/user-guide.html#domain-and-domain-context).
  
  That's the reason why 
  [`AbstractDomainContextBase`](/docs/1.5.2/javadoc/net/jqwik/api/domains/AbstractDomainContextBase.html) 
  is now _deprecated_.

- Provider Methods annotated with `@Provide` now support
  [implicit flat mapping](/docs/1.5.2/user-guide.html#implicit-flat-mapping).

### 1.5.1

<p style="padding-left:1em;font-size:larger">
<a href="/docs/1.5.1/user-guide.html">User guide</a>
and

  - [Generation of Times](/docs/1.5.1/user-guide.html#generation-of-times)
  - [Generation of DateTimes](/docs/1.5.1/user-guide.html#generation-of-datetimes)
    got its first rudimentary support.

- Added `StringArbitrary.excludeChars(char ... toExclude)`. 
  See https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/167.

#### Breaking Changes

- Trying to add a _numerical_ edge case that is outside the arbitrary's
  allowed range will now throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed memory leakage introduced in 1.5.0.

- Shrinking of flat mapped values would sometimes never end.

### 1.5.0

<p style="padding-left:1em;font-size:larger">
<a href="/docs/1.5.0/user-guide.html">User guide</a>
and
<a href="/docs/1.5.0/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>
</p>

#### New and Enhanced Features

- Added constraint annotation `@NotBlank` for String parameters

- Generated email addresses get a few more edge cases

- Shrinking of long Strings (length > 100) is faster now

#### Breaking Changes

- Removed `Arbitrary.unique()` which had been deprecated in 1.4.0

- Removed annotation `@Unique` which had been deprecated in 1.4.0

- Removed `Arbitraries.constant(..)` which had been deprecated in 1.3.2

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed [degraded generation performance](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/166) 
  introduced in version [1.4.0](#140). 

- `Arbitrary.withoutEdgeCases()` did not really get rid of all edge case generation.
  Now it does.

- Some arbitrary types, e.g. `Arbitraries.lazyOf()` could not be used in sampling.
  Now all should work.
  
- Bounded shrinking could previously result in an `OutsideJqwikException`.
  

## 1.4.0

Unless you don't have the time for migrating from `Arbitrary.unique()` to
[the new uniqueness approach](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#uniqueness-constraints)
but still need some of the newly added features, you should directly upgrade to
version [1.5.0](#150).

<p style="padding-left:1em;font-size:larger">
<a href="/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html">User guide</a>
and
<a href="/docs/1.4.0/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>
</p>


#### New and Enhanced Features

- Upgrade to JUnit Platform 1.7.1

- Using `@Property(edgeCases = NONE)` will now also suppress the generation of 
  edge cases in embedded arbitraries.

- You now have the capability to configure an 
  [arbitrary's edge case generation](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#configuring-edge-cases-themselves).

- There is a new annotation attribute `@Property.whenSeedFixed` and a new
  [configuration parameter](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#jqwik-configuration)
  `jqwik.seeds.whenfixed`
  to warn or even fail when a property has been given a fixed random seed. 
  See [this issued](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/138) for more details.
  Many thanks to [osi](https://github.com/osi) for this contribution.

- jqwik's approach to specify uniqueness of generated objects has been completely revamped:

    - `Arbitrary.unique()` and the annotation `@Unique` are now deprecated and will
      be removed in version 1.5.
    - [Uniqueness constraints](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#uniqueness-constraints) 
      are now handled by the elements' container.
    - The new [annotation to require uniqueness](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#unique-elements) 
      is called `@UniqueElements` and applied to the container's type.

- Arbitraries modified through `Arbitrary.unique()`, which is deprecated anyway,
  no longer generate edge cases. This is actually a bug fix since the
  generated edge were not considered for uniqueness.

- There's a new [jqwik module `jqwik-time`](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#time-module)
  which simplifies the generation of dates (and times in a future release).
  Many thanks to [zinki97](https://github.com/zinki97) for this contribution.

- There's a new [jqwik module `jqwik-web`](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#web-module)
  which is currently home of email addresses generation.

- Configuration parameters are now loaded via JUnit's
  [Configuration Parameters](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-config-params) mechanism.
  Parameters specified in `jqwik.properties` continue to work, but are considered deprecated.
  Log messages will be emitted for any used properties with their new name.
  Some [parameter names](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#jqwik-configuration) have also changed.
  Many thanks to [osi](https://github.com/osi) for this contribution.

- Using internal Kotlin methods as properties will now produce the correct name
  as seen in the Kotlin source code.

- The User Guide has been restructured.

- There will now be a warning log entry when a property with more than 1 try has no
  '@ForAll' parameters.

- Promoted APIs from `EXPERIMENTAL` to `MAINTAINED`

  [Web module](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#web-module).

- `@net.jqwik.api.constraints.Email` annotation has been moved to 
  `@net.jqwik.web.api.Email` in new 
  [Web module](/docs/1.4.0/user-guide.html#web-module).

- Parameters annotated with `@Email` will by default only generate
  "standard" email addresses.

- Removed deprecated APIs
    - `Arbitrary.samples(..)`
    - Interface `FalsificationResult`
    - `SampleReportingFormat.reportJavaBean(..)`
    - `Shrinkable.shrink(Falsifier<T> falsifier)`
    - Interface `ShrinkingSequence`

- Unconstrained wildcards are no longer handled in a special way
  but just like unconstrained type variables.
  
- `Arbitrary.array(..)` now returns `ArrayArbitrary` instead of `StreamableArbitrary`

- Fixed bug that could lead to strange edge case generation behaviour 
  when `Arbitrary.edgeCases(edgeCasesConfig)` was used.

- `Arbitraries.lazy()`
  [did not allow exhaustive generation](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/137)
  but does now.

- `SampleReportingFormat.reportJavaBean(..)` can now handle methods named
  `is` or `get`.

- `SampleReportingFormat.reportJavaBean(..)` can now handle properties
  that return `Optional<T>`.

### 1.3.9

  [generate valid email addresses](/docs/1.3.8/user-guide.html#email-address-generation). 

- The header of the label column in 
  [histograms and number range histograms](/docs/1.3.8/user-guide.html#histograms) 
  can now be changed.

#### Breaking Changes

- The distribution of char groups when generating `Character`s or `String`s
  is now weighted by the number of chars in each group so that each possible
  char has the same probability of being generated - except for edge cases.

- `StringArbitrary.withChars(Arbitrary<Character>)` was deprecated

- `CharacterArbitrary.with(Arbitrary<Character>)` was deprecated

#### Bug Fixes

No known bugs.
                                 

### 1.3.7

<p style="padding-left:1em;font-size:larger">

and
<a href="/docs/1.3.7/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>
</p>


#### New and Enhanced Features

- Added two edge cases for generation of integral numbers.

- Reporting of parameters that changed during execution of property is now better
  at detecting real changes.
  
#### Breaking Changes

- _Examples_ with a failing assumption - i.e. throwing a `TestAbortedException` -
  will now be reported as being skipped. See https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/122
  for motivation and reasoning.

#### Bug Fixes

- Using some arbitraries with `Arbitrary.sample()` outside of a jqwik context 
  [no longer worked](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/125). 
  Now it does again.

- The default character generator was erroneously considered to produce unique
  characters. Resulted in a strange to analyze 
  [bug when generating functions](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/126)

and
<a href="/docs/1.3.6/javadoc/index.html">javadoc</a>
</p>


#### New and Enhanced Features

- Shrinking behaviour of arbitraries created with
  `Combinators.withBuilder(..)` is now _much_ better, especially _much_ faster.

- Upgrade to JUnit Platform 1.7.0

#### Breaking Changes

- A maximum of 1000 (instead of 10000) edge cases is generated _per arbitrary_.

- Arbitraries that allow nullables through `Arbitrary.injectNull()` or 
  annotation `@WithNull` will now shrink their values to `null` if possible.

#### Bug Fixes

- With a lot of edge cases sometimes _only_ edge cases were generated. 
  Now the minimum ratio is 1 edge case in 3 generating steps.

- Warning about combinatorial explosion of edge cases generation is
  now [logged only once](https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/119). 

- Edge cases for `oneOf(..)` and `frequencyOf(..)` generators are now correctly being shrunk.

### 1.3.5

#### New and Enhanced Features

- Added `Tuple.of()` and `Tuple.empty()` to create an empty tuple.

- The time out for bounded shrinking can now be changed in `jqwik.properties`

- Sample reporting will now report changes to parameters during property execution

- Added some convenience to use POJOs as builders:

  - `BuilderCombinator.build()`: Return arbitrary of builder itself
  - `CombinableBuilder.inSetter(..)`: Set a builder's property and go on using it

- Added `SampleReportingFormat.reportJavaBean(Object bean)`

#### Breaking Changes

- Shrinking is no longer bound by number of shrinking attempts, but by time with a 10 seconds default.
  The reason is that counting shrinking attempts in a consistent manner was difficult, and
  shrinking could take very very long despite being in `BOUNDED` mode.

#### Bug Fixes

- edge cases generation will be stopped when 10000 edge cases have been found.
  See https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/issues/113

</p>


#### New and Enhanced Features

- `Arbitraries.lazyOf(Supplier<Arbitrary<T>> ...)` is now the method of choice for 
  recursive value generation. It has much better shrinking behaviour than the
  more generic `lazy()` combined with `oneOf()`. 
  Consult [the user guide](/docs/1.3.4/user-guide.html#probabilistic-recursion)
  for an example.

- Added `PropertyLifecycleContext.attributes()`, which allows to query, set and change
  a property method's attributes like number of tries and seed within a
 `AroundPropertyHook`  lifecycle hook.

- Added `@PropertyDefaults` annotation which allows to 
  [set the defaults](/docs/1.3.4/user-guide.html#setting-defaults-for-property-attributes) 
  of all property methods in a container.

#### Breaking Changes

- No known breaking changes

#### Bug Fixes

- Made loading of services thread-safe to allow use of jqwik generators 
  in parallel JUnit runs: https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/pull/117.

#### New and Enhanced Features

- Shrinking has been re-implemented from scratch. Should be more predictable and 
  shrink to smaller samples in most cases.

- Shrinking now has stronger equivalence requirements for falsification:
  - Same type of assertion error or other exception
  - Assertion error or exception thrown from the same code location

- Shrinking `@AlphaChars` will now shrink to uppercase letters (if possible)
  since their Unicode codepoint is smaller.
  
- Negative numbers are shrunk to their positive counterpart if possible

- Changes in property result reporting: 
    - Shrunk samples have now header line "Shrunk Sample (<n> steps)"
    - If no shrinking took place samples have header line "Sample"
    - Original samples now also report the original error
    - Action sequences in stateful properties got `their own reporting format

- `Arbitraries.frequencyOf() now takes covariant arbitrary types

- Made loading of services thread-safe to allow use of jqwik generators 
  in parallel JUnit runs: https://github.com/jlink/jqwik/pull/117.
  Thank you, https://github.com/Danny02!
  
- Added `PropertyLifecycleContext.attributes()`, which allows to query, set and change
  a property method's attributes like number of tries and seed within a
 `AroundPropertyHook`  lifecycle hook.


#### Breaking Changes

- Exceeding shrinking bound is now logged as warning instead of being reported
  through JUnit platform reporting
  
- Deprecated interface `net.jqwik.api.ShrinkingSequence`. Throw all your implementations away!

- Deprecated class `net.jqwik.api.FalsificationResult`. No longer used anywhere.

- Deprecated method `Shrinkable.shrink(Falsifier<T> falsifier)`. 
  It's no longer used anywhere.

#### Bug Fixes

    be situations, though, in which shrinking does no longer find
    the simplest example.
  - `ShrinkingMode.BOUNDED` might interrupt shrinking with completely different results.
  - When using `Reporting.FALSIFIED` you will see different inbetween
    shrinking steps that before.
  - The public interface of `Shrinkable` has changed in an incompatible way,
    but that shouldn't affect anyone but myself.
